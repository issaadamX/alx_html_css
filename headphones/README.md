# Headphones Webpage Project

## Project Overview
This project is a fully functional, responsive web page implemented from scratch using only HTML and CSS. The design is based on a professional UI/UX design by Nicolas Philippot, with the goal to replicate the final design as closely as possible without using any external CSS frameworks or JavaScript.

The webpage showcases a modern headphones-themed landing page with multiple sections including a hero banner, services overview, results statistics, and a contact form.

## Design Reference
The original design was created by Nicolas Philippot and is available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/your-figma-link).  
You can duplicate the project to your drafts in Figma to inspect all design details.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox and Grid)
- Responsive Web Design principles
- Accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, ARIA where applicable)
- No JavaScript or external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) used

## Project Requirements
- The webpage must look visually identical to the provided Figma design.
- The layout must be fully responsive, switching to a mobile-friendly version at screen widths of 480px or less.
- All interactive elements such as links and buttons have specific hover and active states:
  - Links hover/active color: `#FF6565`
  - Buttons hover/active opacity: `0.9`
- The maximum width of the content is 1000px, centered horizontally on the page.
- Fonts used in the design:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - Spin Cycle OT (available from the Figma file or designer resources)
- Some design values may be in floating points; rounding is acceptable.
